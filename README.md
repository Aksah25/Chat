# Chat Application (OOP in Java)

## Description
A simple chat application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. The app simulates a basic chat room where users can send and receive messages. It allows the management of users, messages, and chat rooms. This is a console-based chat app that demonstrates core OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

## Features
- **Multiple Users**: Support for adding multiple users to the chat room.
- **Messaging**: Users can send messages, which are stored and displayed.
- **Message History**: All messages are displayed with timestamps and the sender's name.
- **Chat Room**: Messages are sent to a specific chat room, and the app displays the chat history.
